# Face Value #

Currency conversion using actual denominations.

## Running Face Value ##

Make sure you have `node.js` (0.8) installed on your system. On a Mac with
Homebrew installed, just do `brew install node`.

Go to your cloned directory and do:

    npm install
    volo serve

Then go to `http://localhost:8008` in your browser of choice. You'll want to
be connected to the 'net so you can fetch currency data from Yahoo.
